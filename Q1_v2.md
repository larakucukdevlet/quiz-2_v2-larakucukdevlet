## **Q1: Happy Hour**

Tronokrop Coffee Roasters decided to make a happy-hour after 4pm. To test whether this is a good idea or not, they obtained the probability distribution of the customers' visting hours over the working hours as the following:

- **08-12:** 0.15
- **12-16:** 0.30
- **16-20:** 0.35 
- **20-24:** 0.20

Each number shows the probability of that time-slot being the visiting hour, e.g. the visiting hour of a customer is in between 12-16 with 30% probability. Note that, by definition, probabilities over these hours sum up to 1. Then, the company decided to code a simulation thousands of times and see how many times the customers comes after 16.

In this question, you will implement this simulation for Tronokrop Coffee. Don't worry, some skeleton code is given to you.

**Part A: CDF** You can create samples from the given distribution for the simulation. For that, you need to calculate the corresponding cumulative distribution function (CDF) where each time has the sum of the probabilities of the previous times:

- **08-12:** 0.15
- **12-16:** 0.45
- **16-20:** 0.80
- **20-24:** 1.00

Implement the `calcualte_cdf` function to calculate and return the cumulative distribution for a given probability distribution `input_p`. Both the input and the output should be dictionaries where the key is the hour as a string and the value is the probability in case of input and the cumulative probability in case of output.

**Part B: One Trial** For each trial in the simulation, we need to generate a random number between 0 and 1. In order to find the time in that trial, someone then needs to check which interval that random number falls into in the cumulative distribution from the first question. 

For example, if the generated number is **0.40**, then the visiting hour is **12-16** in that trial; since the first cumulative probability that is greater than or equal to 0.40 is **12-16** with 0.45.

Please type your solution in `one_trial` function. Then type the condition in simulation function. After these, the template code will run it thousands of times, e.g. 10000 times, and reports the number of customers which comes after 4pm out of all trials.

## **Q2: WiFi Routing** 
If routerA sends data to another router, and that router sends data to other routers, is there a way the data reaches routerZ? 

For example:
> 1. routerA sends to routerM
2. routerA sends to routerK
3. routerM sends to routerN
4. routerN sends to routerO
5. routerO sends to routerZ

In this example, there is a route  since `routerA -> routerM -> routerN -> routerO -> routerZ`. 

Another example:
> 1. routerA sends to routerM
2. routerA sends to routerK
4. routerN sends to routerO
5. routerO sends to routerZ

In this example, there is no route from routerA to routerZ


Fill in parts of the recursive function `is_route` that prints True if a route is found, False otherwise. Some starter code and hints are given to you in the function definition.
